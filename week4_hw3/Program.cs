    1) The spring hill book store needs to automate their Special Book Ordering (SBO) system. The store’s SBO system allows customers to order books that are not in stock in the store from the store’s warehouse. 
    When placing a special order book, the customer has a choice to either to pick up the book at the bookstore or have the book shipped to their home directly via UPS. When the store clerk places a special order 
    book by using the SBO system, the warehouse’s Warehouse Shipping System (WSS) will receive a “To Ship Notification” alert from the store’s SBO system. When a book shipment is packed and ready to be shipped, 
    the warehouse’s WSS will email the store’s SBO system to notify it on the incoming shipment and an “Estimated Time Of Arrival”. If the customer chose “Store Pick Up”, the SBO system will then email the customer 
    to notify them about the incoming book order and the estimated arrival date. After the customer picked up their book order from the store, the SBO system will then log the pickup transaction 
    info (date, time, pickup person name and person ID#). If the book order was shipped to the customer’s residential address directly, after the order has been delivered, the UPS Shipping Notification (UPSSN) 
    system will send a delivered email to the store SBO system detailing the delivery info (date, time, driver, scan of recipient’s signature). Please draft the Use Case diagram for the Spring Hill Book Store new SBO system.    < 5 pts >
